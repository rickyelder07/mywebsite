Highlight: FCV Vanguard

The Opportunity
In 2021, our organization won a $2M grant to develop a harbor craft demonstration vessel utilizing zero-emission technology. As a team of 4 with no physical location yet, our scope of work proposed to develop a high-performance hydrogen fuel cell vessel as well as an ecosystem of industry critical mobile hydrogen refueling infrastructure to support it. We shot for the stars.
My Role
For over 4 years, I served as a Project Manager and the Supervising Coordinator between our staff and our grant funder, the California Energy Commission (CEC) . I wrote project milestone reports which gave CEC insight into project status, progress, and results. I ran daily stand-ups, critical project review meetings, and technical advisory committee meetings all while working as a CoS to the CEO to grow our org. We hired team members, built a shop, developed our process, and continued to push.
The Results
The project was a success. The world first fuel cell application was demonstrated to audiences in Southern and Northern California including a launch event as a part of A16Zs tech week with press and a digital presence to match. The technology and market insights gained throughout the project contributed directly to requirements and features for 2 of our core technology products.
The Take away
I developed and sharpened many of my skills as a leader through this process, learning how to motivate hardcore technical experts while translating loose and often open-ended goals from a dynamic executive team. I had to stay organized to keep an eye on all the pieces on the game board while remaining flexible in order to react the needs of the team and the organization.
Highlight: Honda Racing X Pikes Peak

The Opportunity
My organization won the role of sole fueling partner for Honda Racing Corporation US in their attempt to run the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb as the first ever hydrogen powered vehicle entry. This was a high stakes, high visibility product deployment lasting 3.5 weeks and 1300 miles from our HQ or any backup fuel.
My Role
With a belief in my ability to successfully execute on critical business opportunities, I raised my hand to lead the initiative. I owned team management, resource planning, product execution, and customer relationship management on top of my responsibilities as Dir. of  Marketing to generate publicity and coordinate with Honda’s PR team for this historic feat. 
The Results
With the completion of race weekend and Honda’s successful run of the hill climb, our team got traction from multiple major publications, launched site updates, pushed a social campaign, and gained direct product customer feedback. Honda’s Large Project Lead validated our exceptional execution of the engagement when he said “If I get the green light to run this again, you will be the first people we call”.
The Take away
In a constantly shifting and resource limited startup environment opportunities are not handed to you and execution doesn’t come easy. I had to leverage a diverse set of technical, leadership, and soft skills to navigate our customer requests while being confident in my and my team’s ability to execute.

Highlight: Organizational Rebrands

The Opportunity
In 2021 my company made a leap from being a technology services provider (integrating a fuel cell system onto the world’s first hydrogen commercial ferry) to being a technology product company. At the start of 2025 we shifted our market focus from commercial to the defense space. For both of these transitions we revamped our brand to reflect our new focus.
My Role
In 2021 I worked with our Chief Strategy Officer to build a brand that could help represent the purpose and grand strategic vision of the company, market agnostic zero emission energy solutions. I built our logo, website, core messaging and creative assets to help support that narrative. In 2025 I led a team through our evolution to defense. I leaned on a network of US veterans to drive authenticity of the brand while collaborating with our creatives to realize that vision.
The Results
The brand developed in 2021 successfully told the story of a rapidly growing hydrogen technology company in an industry and market motivated by solving our planets climate crisis. After less than a year with the brand we garnered attention from oil and energy super majors Chevron and Trafigura as well as Crowley, the largest shipping and logistics company in the US, and raised our $8.75M Series A. 2025 has been met with significant market traction as the company looks toward raising more capital and growing a new customer base in defense.
The Take away
Throughout these rebrands I have developed a significant portfolio around planning, leading, and executing on strategic marketing campaigns. I have learned how to craft my creative lens for specific audiences and build goal driven materials, messaging, and marketing assets.
